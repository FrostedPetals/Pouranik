## What's Pouranik?

Pouranik is a web platform where you can:

- **Search and explore books** from public APIs (like Google Books)
- **Browse genres** and discover hidden gems
- **Write reviews** and read what others say
- **Join book groups**, share your thoughts, and build reading circles
- **Buy and sell second-hand books**
- **Set reading goals** and finish books with a personal timer
- **Chat with group members**, like a digital book club!

It‚Äôs more than a reading app. It‚Äôs your **reading journey, tracked and shared**.

## Why the name **"Pouranik"**?

The name **"Pouranik"** comes from the Sanskrit word _PaurƒÅ·πáika_, meaning **ancient, mythical, or timeless**.

We chose this name because stories, whether from ancient scriptures or modern fiction, are timeless.  
**Pouranik** is built on that idea: to help people connect with the magic of reading, share thoughts, and grow together through books.
